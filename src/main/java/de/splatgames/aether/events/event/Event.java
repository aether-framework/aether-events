/**
 * Represents a base class for all events in the event system.

 * <p>All events must extend this class to be processed by the {@code EventBus}.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Event Name</h2>
 * <p>Each event has a name, which defaults to the simple class name if not explicitly set.
 * The name is primarily used for debugging and logging purposes.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Events</h2>
 * <p>Events can be marked as asynchronous during instantiation. An asynchronous event
 * is not guaranteed to be executed on the main thread, and event handlers should be
 * designed accordingly.</p>
