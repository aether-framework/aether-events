/**
 * Defines the priority levels for event execution.
 *
 * <p>Each event handler is assigned a priority, determining the order in which it is executed
 * relative to other handlers for the same event type. Handlers with a higher priority
 * are executed before those with a lower priority.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Priority Levels</h2>
 * <p>The available priorities, in order of execution:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #LOWEST} - Executed first, used for preliminary modifications.</li>
 *     <li>{@link #LOW} - Executed after {@code LOWEST}, typically for secondary modifications.</li>
 *     <li>{@link #NORMAL} - Default priority, used for general event handling.</li>
 *     <li>{@link #HIGH} - Executed before {@code NORMAL}, often for override behavior.</li>
 *     <li>{@link #HIGHEST} - Executed last before {@code MONITOR}, for critical handling.</li>
 *     <li>{@link #MONITOR} - Executed last, intended for observing final event state without modification.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Handlers registered with {@code MONITOR} should avoid modifying the event, as
 * they are meant to act as observers.</p>
