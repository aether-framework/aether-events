/**
 * A builder for constructing instances of {@link EventBus}.
 *
 * <p>This builder allows customization of various {@code EventBus} parameters before instantiation.
 * It provides a fluent API for setting options such as logging behavior, warning states,
 * and global event handling configurations.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * EventBus eventBus = EventBus.builder()
 *     .withLogger(LoggerFactory.getLogger("CustomLogger"))
 *     .withUseTimings(true)
 *     .withThrowOnRegistered(false)
 *     .build();

 *
 * <h2>Thread Safety</h2>
 * <p>This class is not thread-safe. It is intended to be used during a single-threaded
 * configuration phase before the {@code EventBus} is built.</p>
