/**
 * Marks a method as an event listener in the Aether Event System.
 *
 * <p>Methods annotated with {@code @Subscribe} will be automatically detected
 * and invoked when an event of the corresponding type is posted to the event bus.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class MyEventListener implements Listener {
 *
 *     @Subscribe
 *     public void onCustomEvent(CustomEvent event) {
 *         System.out.println("Received event: " + event);
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>To activate the listener, the containing class must implement {@link de.splatgames.aether.events.listener.Listener}
 * and be registered with the event bus using {@link de.splatgames.aether.events.bus.EventBus#subscribe(Listener) subscribe(Listener)}.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Priority Handling</h2>
 * <p>The {@link #priority()} value determines the order in which event handlers are called.</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Higher priority values are executed first.</li>
 *     <li>Default priority is {@link de.splatgames.aether.events.event.EventPriority#NORMAL}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Ignoring Cancelled Events</h2>
 * <p>By default, cancelled events are still passed to all listeners. If {@link #ignoreCancelled()} is set to {@code true},
 * the method will not receive events that have been marked as cancelled.</p>
