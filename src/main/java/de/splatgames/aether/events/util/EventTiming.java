/**
 * A utility class for measuring execution time of events and tracking intermediate splits.
 * This class provides nanosecond-precision timing and allows for multiple time splits
 * to be recorded before stopping the timer.
 *
 * <p>The timer starts upon instantiation and can be stopped using {@link #stop()}.
 * Intermediate timestamps (splits) can be recorded using {@link #split()}, allowing
 * for performance analysis of different execution segments.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Usage Example</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * EventTiming timing = new EventTiming("ExampleTask");
 *
 * // Execute some logic
 * timing.split();
 *
 * // Execute more logic
 * timing.stop();
 *
 * System.out.println("Total time: " + timing.getDurationMillis() + " ms");
 * System.out.println("Splits: " + timing.getSplitsMillis());
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>Thread Safety</h2>
 * <p>Instances of this class are not thread-safe and should be used within a single thread.
 * If shared among multiple threads, external synchronization is required.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Behavior</h2>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Once stopped, the timing cannot be resumed.</li>
 *     <li>Calling {@link #split()} after stopping will result in an {@link IllegalStateException}.</li>
 *     <li>Durations are measured in nanoseconds but exposed in milliseconds for easier interpretation.</li>
 * </ul>
