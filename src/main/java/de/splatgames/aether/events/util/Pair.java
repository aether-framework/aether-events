/**
 * A simple immutable container that holds a key-value pair.
 * This class is useful for returning two related values from a method or
 * for use in map-like structures that do not require a full {@link java.util.Map}.
 *
 * <p>{@code Pair} instances are immutable and support generic types for both
 * keys and values. The key and value can be of any type, including {@code null}.
 * However, users should be cautious when using mutable objects as keys,
 * as they may lead to unexpected behavior when used in collections
 * that rely on key equality.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Usage Example</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * Pair<String, Integer> pair = Pair.of("Alice", 30);
 * System.out.println(pair.key() + " is " + pair.value() + " years old.");
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>Equality and Hashing</h2>
 * <p>The {@code Pair} class follows standard equality and hash code behavior:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Two {@code Pair} instances are considered equal if both their key and value
 *         are equal according to {@link Object#equals(Object)}.</li>
 *     <li>The hash code is computed based on the hash codes of the key and value.</li>
 *     <li>The {@code toString()} method returns a string representation in the form
 *         {@code (key, value)}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Limitations</h2>
 * <p>Unlike entries in {@link java.util.Map}, a {@code Pair} does not enforce
 * uniqueness of keys when used in collections. If unique keys are required,
 * consider using a {@code Map<K, V>} instead.</p>
 *
 * @param <K> the type of the key
 * @param <V> the type of the value
