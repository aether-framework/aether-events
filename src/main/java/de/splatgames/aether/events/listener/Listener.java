package de.splatgames.aether.events.listener;

/**
 * A marker interface for all event listeners in the Aether Event System.
 *
 * <p>Any class that wishes to receive events through the {@link de.splatgames.aether.events.bus.EventBus EventBus}
 * must implement this interface.
 * The presence of this interface allows the event bus to recognize
 * the class as a valid subscriber when calling {@link de.splatgames.aether.events.bus.EventBus#subscribe(Listener) subscribe(Listener)}.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Event Subscription</h2>
 * <p>To listen for events, a class must:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Implement {@code Listener}.</li>
 *     <li>Declare one or more methods annotated with {@link de.splatgames.aether.events.annotation.Subscribe Subscribe}.</li>
 *     <li>Register an instance of the class to the event bus using {@link de.splatgames.aether.events.bus.EventBus#subscribe(Listener) subscribe(Listener)}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * <p>A simple example of an event listener:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class MyEventListener implements Listener {
 *
 *     @Subscribe
 *     public void onCustomEvent(CustomEvent event) {
 *         System.out.println("Received event: " + event);
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>To activate the listener, it must be registered:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * EventBus eventBus = EventBus.builder().build();
 * eventBus.subscribe(new MyEventListener());
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>Importance in Aether Event System</h2>
 * <p>This interface is a core part of the Aether Event System, as it ensures that only explicitly declared
 * listeners can receive events.
 * This prevents unintended method calls and allows precise control over
 * event handling.</p>
